# What day order is it? :confused:
--------------------------------------
#### When to use it?
1. You study in a college where the university follows the day order time-table instead of week time-table
2. You bunk classes a lot
3. You want to know which day order will it be when your favourite movie is releasing.
4. How many hours will you miss when you are chillin' at home next holidays. 
5. When you are bored and have nothing better to do :stuck_out_tongue:

This app can be used as an endpoint API to get the day order on a date. Just give integer arguements in place of `<date>`, `<month>` and `<year>` and pass the request to `https://dayorder.herokuapp.com/day-order?date=<date>&month=<month>&year=<year>`
